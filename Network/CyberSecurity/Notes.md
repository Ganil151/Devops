  - Encryption : are rules or methods used to conceal outgoing data and uncover or decrypt incoming data. Data in restricted zones should have much higher encryption standards.
  - Task to perform:
    - Firewall rules maintenance
    - Network log analysis
    - Patch updates
    - Server backups
  - Network Log Analysis : the process of examining network logs to identify events of interest

- Cloud Network Hardening

## Part Eight: Computing basics for Security

> Linux Operating System : is open source operating system

- The Architecture of Linux
  - Components of Linux
    - User : the interacting with the computer, linux is a multi-user system
    - Applications : a program that performs a specific task
    - Shell : the command-line interpreter, it processes commands and outputs the results.
    - Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) : the component of the Linux OS that organizes data.
    - Kernel : the component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory
    - Hardware : the physical components of a computer

- Different distributions of Linux
  - Over 600 version of Linux
  - Kali-Linux:
    - Penetration Testing Tools:
      - Metasploit : to look for and exploit vulnerablilites on machines
      - Burp Suite : to test for weaknesses in web applications
      - John the Ripper : to guess passwords
      - tcpdump : is a command-line packet analyzer, it's used to capture network traffic
      - Wireshark : used for analyze live and captured network traffic
      - Autopsy : analyze hard drives and smartphones
      - Nmap (short for Network Mapper) is a powerful, open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing.
  - Digital forensics : the practice of collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened after an attack

- The Shell : the command-line interpreter, it processes commands and outputs the results.
  - Command : is a instruction telling the computer to do something, the shell communicates with the kernel to execute these commands
  - Standard input : is information received by the OS via the command line
  - echo : a linux command that outputs a specified string of text
  - String data : is data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters
  - Standard output : information returned by the OS through the shell
  - Standard error : error messages returned by the OS through the shell
  
> Linux Command line

- Bash : is the default shell in most Linux distributions
- Argument (Linux) Specific information needed by a command
- Root directory : is the highest-level directory in Linux
- pwd : prints the working directory onto the screen
- ls : displays the names of files and directories in the current working directory
- ls -l : displays permissions to files and directories
- ls -a : displays hidden files
- ls -la : displays permissions to files and directories, including hidden files
- cd : navigates between directories
- cat : displays the content of a file
- head : displays just the beginning of a file, by default 10 lines
- grep : searches a specified file and returns all lines in the file containing a specified string
- Piping | : sends the standard output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing, piping also involves redirection, output from one command is sent through the pipe and then is used on the other side of the pipe
- mkdir : creates a new directory
- rmdir : removes, or deletes, a directory
- touch : creates a new file
- rm : removes or delete a file
- mv : moves a file or directory to a new location
- cp : copies a file or directory into a new location
- man : displays information on other commands and how they work
- whatis : display a description of a command on a single line
- apropos : searches the manual page descriptions for a specified string
- Permissions : the type of access granted for a file or directory
- Authorization : the concept of granting access to specific  
- Permissions of Linux:
  - Read = r : read permissions means content on the file can be read, on directory means you can read all the files on the directory
  - Write = w : write permissions on a file allow modifications of content on the file, on a directory indicate that new files can be created in that directory
  - Execute = x : execute permissions on files mean that the file can be executed if it's an executable file. Execute permissions on directories allow users to enter into a directory and access its files
  - Types of permission owners:
    - Users = u : the user is the owner of the file.
    - Group = : every user is a part of a certain group, a group consists of several users and this is one way to manage a multi-user environment
    - Other = o : can be considered all other users on the system
  - Permissions are represented with a 10-character string (drwxrwxrwx)
  - Options : modify the behavior of the command
  - chmod : changes permissions on files and directories
    - example : chmod g+w, o-r access.txt
- Root user (or superuser) : a user with elevated privileges to modify the system.
  - sudo : temporarily grants elevated permissions to specific users
  - useradd : adds a user to the system = sudo useradd username
  - userdel : deletes a user from the system = sudo userdel username
  - groupadd : to add a group on linux = sudo groupadd groupname
  
> SQL to query databases:

- Structured Query Language (SQL) : is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database
- Database : an organized collection of information or data
  - Spreadsheets : designed for a single user or a small team or store less data
  - accessed by multiple people simultaneously  
  - store massive amounts of data
  - performs complex tasks while accessing data

  - Relational databases : is a structured database containing tables that are related to each other.
    - Primary key : a column where every row has a unique entry
    - Foreign key : a colum ina table that is primary key in another table
  
- SQL queries
  - Query : ia request for data from a database table or combination of tables
  - Log : a record of events that occur within an organization's systems
  - SELECT : is a keyword that indicates which column to return
  - FROM : indicates which table to query
  - Syntax : the rules that determine what is correctly structured in a computing language
  - Operator : a symbol or keyword that represents an operation
    - = : equals
    - > : greater than
    - < : less than
    - <> : not equal too
    - > = : greater than or equal too
    - < = : less than or equal too
    - BETWEEN : is an operator that filters for numbers or dates within a range
    - AND : specifies that both conditions must be met simultaneously
    - OR : The OR operator also connects two conditions, but OR specifies that either condition can be met. It returns results where the first condition, the second condition, or both are met.
    - NOT :  operator negates a condition. This means that SQL returns all records that don’t match the condition specified in the query.
    - WHERE : indicates the condition for a filter
    - LIKE : used with WHERE to search for a pattern in a column
    - INNER JOIN : returns rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than one table
    - Exp: SELECT *
      FROM employees
      WHERE title LIKE 'IT%';

- SQL filters
  - Filtering : selecting data that match a certain condition
  - Common data types:
    - String : data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters
    - Numeric : data consisting of numbers
    - Date and Time : data representing a date and / or time

## Part Nine: Assets, Threats and Vulnerabilities

- Assets organizations protect
  
  - Asset management : the process of tracking assets and the risk that affect them
  
  - Asset inventory : a catalog of assets that need to protected
  
  - Asset classification : the practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization
    - Levels of asset classification
      - Public : is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they're released
      - Internal-only : describes assets that are available to employees and business partners
      - Confidential : refers to assets whose disclosure could lead to significant negative impact on an organization.
      - Restricted : is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets, like need-to-know information
  
  - States of Data to protect:
    - Data in use : is data being accessed by one or more users
    - Data in transit : is data traveling from one point to another
    - Data at rest : is data not currently being accessed
    - Information Security (InfoSec) : the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users
  
  - Security systems and controls:
    - Types of risk categories
      - Damage
      - Disclosure
      - Loss of information
      - Attack
      - Human Error
  
  - Elements of a security plan:
    - Policy : is set of rules that reduces risk and protects information
    - Standards : references that inform how to set policies
    - Procedures : Step-by-step instructions to perform a specific security task
  
  - Compliance : the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations
  
  - Regulations : rules set by a government or other authority to control the way something is done  

- Common vulnerabilities in systems
- Threats to assets security
