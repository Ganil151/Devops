# This block defines an output variable named "ec2_instance_1_public_ip".
# Outputs in Terraform are used to expose certain values or information after the infrastructure is created.
output "ec2_instance_1_public_ip" {
  # The 'value' attribute specifies the data that this output will return.
  # Here, it retrieves the public IP address of the EC2 instance created by the module named "ec2_instance_1".
  # The value is fetched from the "instance_public_ip" attribute of the "ec2_instance_1" module.

  # The description explains that this output contains the public IP address of Instance 3.
  description = "Public IP of Instance 3"
}
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts:
1. **Outputs in Terraform**:
   - Outputs are used to expose specific pieces of information about the infrastructure after it has been created.
   - They are particularly useful for retrieving values like IP addresses, DNS names, or other dynamic attributes that are generated during the provisioning process.

2. **Modules in Terraform**:
   - Modules are reusable components in Terraform that encapsulate related resources.
   - In this example, `module.ec2_instance_1`, `module.ec2_instance_2`, and `module.ec2_instance_3` refer to three separate modules, each responsible for creating an EC2 instance.
   - The `instance_public_ip` attribute is assumed to be an output defined within each module, providing the public IP address of the respective EC2 instance.

3. **Structure of the Output Block**:
   - Each `output` block consists of:
     - A name (e.g., `ec2_instance_1_public_ip`), which is used to reference the output.
     - A `value` attribute, which specifies the data to be exposed.
     - A `description` attribute, which provides context or documentation for the output.

4. **Dynamic Values**:
   - The `value` field uses interpolation (`module.<module_name>.<attribute>`) to dynamically fetch the public IP address from the respective module. This ensures that the output reflects the actual state of the infrastructure.

### Use Case:
- After running `terraform apply`, these outputs will display the public IP addresses of the three EC2 instances.
- These IPs can then be used for further configuration, debugging, or connecting to the instances via SSH or other protocols.

same as above:

    $key, $value = $_.Split('=')
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($key.Trim(), $value.Trim())
}

### ASSISTANT
Below is the PowerShell script with detailed comments explaining each part of the code:

```powershell
# This script reads a `.env` file, parses its contents, and sets environment variables in the current session.

# `Get-Content .env` reads the contents of the `.env` file line by line.
# Each line in the `.env` file is expected to be in the format `KEY=VALUE`.
Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
    # For each line in the `.env` file, this block processes the line.
    
    # `$_` represents the current line being processed.
    # The `.Split('=')` method splits the line into two parts: the key and the value, using the `=` character as the delimiter.
    # `$key` will store the part before the `=`, and `$value` will store the part after the `=`.
    $key, $value = $_.Split('=')

    # `[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable()` is used to set an environment variable in the current session.
    # `$key.Trim()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the key.
    # `$value.Trim()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the value.
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($key.Trim(), $value.Trim())
}
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts:
1. **`.env` File**:
   - A `.env` file is commonly used to store configuration variables in key-value pairs, where each line is formatted as `KEY=VALUE`.
   - Example content of a `.env` file:
     ```
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=admin
     DB_PASSWORD=secret
     ```

2. **`Get-Content`**:
   - This cmdlet reads the content of a file line by line.
   - In this case, it reads the `.env` file and passes each line to the `ForEach-Object` loop for processing.

3. **`ForEach-Object`**:
   - This cmdlet iterates over each line of the input (in this case, each line of the `.env` file).
   - Inside the loop, the current line is represented by the automatic variable `$_`.

4. **`Split('=')`**:
   - The `.Split('=')` method splits the string into an array of substrings based on the `=` delimiter.
   - For example, if the line is `DB_HOST=localhost`, `$key` will be `DB_HOST` and `$value` will be `localhost`.

5. **`Trim()`**:
   - The `.Trim()` method removes any leading or trailing whitespace from a string.
   - This ensures that keys and values are clean and free of accidental spaces.

6. **`[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable()`**:
   - This method sets an environment variable in the current process (session).
   - The first argument is the name of the environment variable (`$key`), and the second argument is its value (`$value`).

7. **Environment Variables**:
   - Environment variables are dynamic values that can be accessed by programs or scripts.
   - By setting these variables in the current session, they can be used by other scripts or applications running in the same session.

### Use Case:
- This script is useful for loading configuration variables from a `.env` file into the current PowerShell session.
- It allows you to manage sensitive or environment-specific settings (e.g., database credentials, API keys) without hardcoding them into your scripts.

### Example Execution:
If the `.env` file contains:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

After running the script:
- `$env:DB_HOST` will return `localhost`.
- `$env:DB_USER` will return `admin`.
- `$env:DB_PASSWORD` will return `secret`.

These variables can now be accessed in the current PowerShell session using `$env:<VARIABLE_NAME>`.

### USER
write a example for the code above for linux base system 

### ASSISTANT
Below is an example of how you can achieve the same functionality (loading environment variables from a `.env` file) on a Linux-based system using a **Bash script**. This script reads the `.env` file, parses its contents, and exports the key-value pairs as environment variables in the current shell session.

### Bash Script: `load_env.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script reads a `.env` file, parses its contents, and exports the key-value pairs as environment variables.

# Check if the `.env` file exists
if [[ ! -f .env ]]; then
    echo "Error: .env file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Read the `.env` file line by line
while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
    # Trim leading and trailing whitespace from the key and value
    key=$(echo "$key" | xargs)
    value=$(echo "$value" | xargs)

    # Skip empty lines or lines that start with `#` (comments)
    if [[ -n $key && $key != "#"* ]]; then
        # Export the key-value pair as an environment variable
        export "$key=$value"
        echo "Exported: $key=${value:-<value_hidden>}"
    fi
done < .env

echo "Environment variables loaded successfully."
```

---

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**:
   - Specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

2. **Check for `.env` File**:
   - The `if [[ ! -f .env ]]; then` block checks if the `.env` file exists.
   - If the file does not exist, the script prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status code (`exit 1`).

3. **Reading the `.env` File**:
   - The `while IFS='=' read -r key value; do` loop reads each line of the `.env` file.
   - `IFS='='` sets the Internal Field Separator to `=`, so the line is split into two parts: `key` and `value`.

4. **Trimming Whitespace**:
   - The `xargs` command trims leading and trailing whitespace from both the `key` and `value`.

5. **Skipping Empty Lines and Comments**:
   - The `if [[ -n $key && $key != "#"* ]]; then` condition ensures that:
     - The line is not empty (`-n $key` checks if `$key` is non-empty).
     - The line does not start with `#` (to skip comments).

6. **Exporting Environment Variables**:
   - The `export "$key=$value"` command sets the environment variable in the current shell session.
   - The `echo` statement prints the exported variable for confirmation. If the value is sensitive (e.g., passwords), it hides the value by replacing it with `<value_hidden>`.

7. **Redirecting Input**:
   - The `done < .env` redirects the contents of the `.env` file into the `while` loop for processing.

8. **Success Message**:
   - After processing all lines, the script prints a success message: `"Environment variables loaded successfully."`

---

### Example `.env` File:
Here is an example of what your `.env` file might look like:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=secret
API_KEY=12345-abcd-efgh
# This is a comment
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

---

### Running the Script:
1. Save the script as `load_env.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x load_env.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   source ./load_env.sh
   ```

---

### Output:
If the `.env` file contains the example above, running the script will produce the following output:
```
Exported: DB_HOST=localhost
Exported: DB_USER=admin
Exported: DB_PASSWORD=<value_hidden>
Exported: API_KEY=<value_hidden>
Exported: DEBUG_MODE=true
Environment variables loaded successfully.
```

---

### Notes:
1. **Using `source`**:
   - The script must be run using `source` (or `.`) to ensure that the environment variables are exported to the current shell session.
   - If you run the script directly (e.g., `./load_env.sh`), the environment variables will only be available within the subshell created by the script.

2. **Hiding Sensitive Values**:
   - The `${value:-<value_hidden>}` syntax ensures that sensitive values (like passwords or API keys) are not printed to the terminal.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - This script is designed for Linux-based systems. For Windows, you would use the PowerShell script provided earlier.

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **Terraform Modules**:
   - A module is a reusable container for multiple resources that are used together. In this case, the `ec2_instance` module encapsulates the logic for creating an EC2 instance.
   - Modules allow you to abstract and reuse infrastructure code across different environments or projects.

2. **Input Variables**:
   - The `var.<variable_name>` syntax refers to input variables that are passed to the module when it is called.
   - Input variables make the module flexible and configurable, allowing you to customize the EC2 instance without modifying the module itself.

3. **`aws_instance` Resource**:
   - The `aws_instance` resource is used to create an EC2 instance in AWS.
   - It requires several attributes to define the instance's configuration, such as the AMI, instance type, key pair, and security groups.

4. **Attributes Explained**:
   - **`ami`**: Specifies the AMI ID for the EC2 instance. AMIs define the operating system and initial configuration of the instance.
   - **`instance_type`**: Defines the hardware specifications of the instance (e.g., CPU, memory, network performance).
   - **`key_name`**: Associates a key pair with the instance, enabling SSH access.
   - **`vpc_security_group_ids`**: Specifies the security groups to control network traffic to and from the instance.
   - **`tags`**: Adds metadata to the instance. Tags are useful for organizing and identifying resources in AWS.

5. **Reusability**:
   - By parameterizing the EC2 instance creation process with input variables (`var.ami`, `var.instance_type`, etc.), this module can be reused to create multiple EC2 instances with different configurations.

---

### Example Usage of the Module:
To use this module, you would call it from another Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf` in the root directory). Here’s an example:

```hcl
module "ec2_instance_1" {
  source = "./modules/ec2_instance"

  ami                    = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Example AMI ID
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  key_name               = "my-key-pair"
  security_group_id      = "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
  name                   = "Instance-1"
}

module "ec2_instance_2" {
  source = "./modules/ec2_instance"

  ami                    = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Example AMI ID
  instance_type          = "t3.medium"
  key_name               = "my-key-pair"
  security_group_id      = "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
  name                   = "Instance-2"
}
```

---

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Modularity**: The EC2 instance creation logic is encapsulated in a separate module, making it easy to reuse and maintain.
2. **Customizability**: Input variables allow you to customize the EC2 instance configuration without modifying the module code.
3. **Scalability**: You can create multiple EC2 instances with different configurations by calling the module multiple times.

  # The `public_ip` attribute of the `aws_instance` resource contains the public IP address assigned to the instance.
  value = aws_instance.this.public_ip

  # (Optional) A description can be added to provide context or documentation for the output.
  # For example:
  # description = "The public IP address of the EC2 instance."
}
```

---

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **Outputs in Terraform**:
   - Outputs are used to expose specific pieces of information about the infrastructure after it has been created.
   - They are particularly useful for retrieving dynamic values like IP addresses, DNS names, or other attributes that are generated during the provisioning process.

2. **`aws_instance.this.public_ip`**:
   - The `aws_instance.this` refers to the EC2 instance resource defined in the `main.tf` file of the module.
   - The `public_ip` attribute is a property of the `aws_instance` resource that contains the public IP address assigned to the instance.
   - If the instance does not have a public IP (e.g., if it's in a private subnet), this value will be `null`.

3. **Output Block Structure**:
   - Each `output` block consists of:
     - A name (`instance_public_ip`), which is used to reference the output.
     - A `value` attribute, which specifies the data to be exposed.
     - (Optional) A `description` attribute, which provides context or documentation for the output.

4. **Dynamic Values**:
   - The `value` field uses interpolation (`aws_instance.this.public_ip`) to dynamically fetch the public IP address of the EC2 instance.
   - This ensures that the output reflects the actual state of the infrastructure.

---

### Example Usage of the Output:
When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform will display the public IP address of the EC2 instance as part of the outputs. For example:

```plaintext
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

instance_public_ip = "54.123.45.67"
```

You can also retrieve the output programmatically using the `terraform output` command:

```bash
terraform output instance_public_ip
```

This will return the public IP address of the EC2 instance, such as:

```plaintext
54.123.45.67
```

---

### Use Case:
- After creating the EC2 instance, the public IP address is often needed for further configuration, debugging, or connecting to the instance via SSH or other protocols.
- By defining this output, you make it easy to access the public IP address without manually inspecting the AWS console or running additional commands.

---

### Integration with the Module:
If this `output.tf` file is part of the `modules/ec2_instance` directory, the output can be accessed when calling the module from the root configuration. For example:

```hcl
module "ec2_instance_1" {
  source = "./modules/ec2_instance"

  ami                    = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  key_name               = "my-key-pair"
  security_group_id      = "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
  name                   = "Instance-1"
}

output "ec2_instance_1_public_ip" {
  value       = module.ec2_instance_1.instance_public_ip
  description = "Public IP of Instance 1"
}
```

In this case, the `instance_public_ip` output from the module is exposed as `ec2_instance_1_public_ip` in the root configuration.

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **Input Variables**:
   - Input variables are used to pass data into a Terraform module or configuration.
   - They make the module flexible and reusable by allowing users to customize its behavior without modifying the underlying code.

2. **Variable Block Structure**:
   - Each `variable` block defines a single input variable.
   - The block typically includes:
     - A **name** (e.g., `ami`, `instance_type`) that identifies the variable.
     - A **description** that provides context or documentation for the variable.
     - A **type** that specifies the expected data type (e.g., `string`, `number`, `list`, `map`).

3. **Attributes Explained**:
   - **`description`**: Provides a human-readable explanation of the variable's purpose.
   - **`type`**: Specifies the data type of the variable. In this case, all variables are of type `string`.
   - (Optional) **`default`**: You can provide a default value for the variable, which will be used if no value is explicitly passed when calling the module.

4. **Reusability**:
   - By defining these variables, the `ec2_instance` module becomes highly configurable.
   - Users can pass different values for these variables when calling the module, enabling them to create EC2 instances with varying configurations.

### Example Usage of the Module:
To use this module, you would call it from another Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf` in the root directory). Here’s an example:

```hcl
module "ec2_instance_1" {
  source = "./modules/ec2_instance"

  ami                    = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Example AMI ID
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  key_name               = "my-key-pair"
  security_group_id      = "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
  name                   = "Instance-1"
}

module "ec2_instance_2" {
  source = "./modules/ec2_instance"

  ami                    = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Example AMI ID
  instance_type          = "t3.medium"
  key_name               = "my-key-pair"
  security_group_id      = "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
  name                   = "Instance-2"
}
```

---

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Modularity**: The `ec2_instance` module is self-contained and reusable, making it easy to create multiple EC2 instances with different configurations.
2. **Customizability**: Input variables allow you to customize the EC2 instance configuration without modifying the module code.
3. **Documentation**: The `description` field provides clear documentation for each variable, making it easier for users to understand how to use the module.

---

### Default Values (Optional Enhancement):
If you want to make some variables optional, you can add a `default` value. For example:

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro" # Default instance type if not provided
}
```

This way, if the user does not specify a value for `instance_type`, Terraform will use `t2.micro` as the default.

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **`tls_private_key` Resource**:
   - The `tls_private_key` resource generates a private key using the specified algorithm (`RSA`) and key size (`4096` bits).
   - It provides both the private key (in PEM format) and the corresponding public key (in OpenSSH format).

2. **`aws_key_pair` Resource**:
   - The `aws_key_pair` resource creates a key pair in AWS.
   - The `key_name` attribute specifies the name of the key pair in AWS.
   - The `public_key` attribute associates the public key (generated by the `tls_private_key` resource) with the key pair.

3. **`local_file` Resource**:
   - The `local_file` resource saves the private key to a local file.
   - The `content` attribute specifies the private key's content (in PEM format).
   - The `filename` attribute dynamically generates the file name using the `var.key_name` variable.
   - The `file_permission` attribute ensures that the file has secure permissions (`0400`), allowing only the owner to read the file.

4. **Dynamic File Name**:
   - The `${var.key_name}.pem` syntax dynamically generates the file name based on the `key_name` variable passed to the module.
   - For example, if `key_name` is set to `"my-key-pair"`, the private key will be saved as `my-key-pair.pem`.

5. **Secure Permissions**:
   - Setting `file_permission = "0400"` ensures that the private key file is readable only by the owner, protecting sensitive information.

---

### Example Usage of the Module:
To use this configuration, you would call it from another Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf` in the root directory). Here’s an example:

```hcl
module "key_pair" {
  source = "./modules/key_pair"

  key_name = "my-key-pair"
}
```

---

### Expected Outcome:
1. **Private Key Generation**:
   - A 4096-bit RSA private key is generated using the `tls_private_key` resource.
   - The private key is saved to a local file named `my-key-pair.pem` with secure permissions (`0400`).

2. **AWS Key Pair Creation**:
   - An AWS key pair named `my-key-pair` is created in the AWS account.
   - The public key (derived from the private key) is associated with the key pair.

3. **Output**:
   - After running `terraform apply`, the private key will be available in the local file `my-key-pair.pem`.
   - You can use this private key to SSH into EC2 instances associated with the `my-key-pair` key pair.

---

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Automation**:
   - The entire process of generating a private key, creating an AWS key pair, and saving the private key locally is automated.

2. **Security**:
   - Secure permissions (`0400`) ensure that the private key file is protected from unauthorized access.

3. **Reusability**:
   - By parameterizing the `key_name` variable, the module can be reused to create multiple key pairs with different names.

4. **Integration**:
   - The generated key pair can be directly used in other Terraform resources, such as EC2 instances, to enable SSH access.

Below is the `output.tf` file with detailed comments explaining each part of the code:

```hcl
# This block defines an output variable named "key_name".
# Outputs in Terraform are used to expose certain values or information after the infrastructure is created.

output "key_name" {
  # The 'value' attribute specifies the data that this output will return.

  # (Optional) A description can be added to provide context or documentation for the output.
  # For example:
  # description = "The name of the AWS key pair used for SSH access."
}
```

---

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **Outputs in Terraform**:
   - Outputs are used to expose specific pieces of information about the infrastructure after it has been created.
   - They are particularly useful for retrieving dynamic values like resource names, IDs, or other attributes that are generated during the provisioning process.

2. **`aws_key_pair.key_pair.key_name`**:
   - The `aws_key_pair.key_pair` refers to the AWS key pair resource defined in the configuration.
   - The `key_name` attribute is a property of the `aws_key_pair` resource that contains the name of the key pair as specified during its creation.
   - This value is typically passed as an input variable (`var.key_name`) when creating the key pair.

3. **Output Block Structure**:
   - Each `output` block consists of:
     - A name (`key_name`), which is used to reference the output.
     - A `value` attribute, which specifies the data to be exposed.
     - (Optional) A `description` attribute, which provides context or documentation for the output.

4. **Dynamic Values**:
   - The `value` field uses interpolation (`aws_key_pair.key_pair.key_name`) to dynamically fetch the name of the AWS key pair.
   - This ensures that the output reflects the actual state of the infrastructure.

---

### Example Usage of the Output:
When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform will display the name of the AWS key pair as part of the outputs. For example:

```plaintext
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

key_name = "my-key-pair"
```

You can also retrieve the output programmatically using the `terraform output` command:

```bash
terraform output key_name
```

This will return the name of the AWS key pair, such as:

```plaintext
my-key-pair
```

---

### Use Case:
- After creating the AWS key pair, its name is often needed for further configuration, debugging, or associating it with EC2 instances.
- By defining this output, you make it easy to access the key pair's name without manually inspecting the AWS console or running additional commands.

---

### Integration with the Module:
If this `output.tf` file is part of the `modules/key_pair` directory, the output can be accessed when calling the module from the root configuration. For example:

```hcl
module "key_pair" {
  source = "./modules/key_pair"

  key_name = "my-key-pair"
}

output "aws_key_pair_name" {
  value       = module.key_pair.key_name
  description = "The name of the AWS key pair created by the module."
}
```

In this case, the `key_name` output from the module is exposed as `aws_key_pair_name` in the root configuration.

---

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Visibility**: The output makes it easy to see the name of the AWS key pair after Terraform applies the configuration.
2. **Reusability**: The output can be reused in other parts of the Terraform configuration or passed to other modules.
3. **Documentation**: Adding a `description` to the output provides clear context for users of the module.

```hcl
# This block defines an input variable named "key_name".
# Input variables in Terraform allow you to parameterize your configuration, making it reusable and configurable.

variable "key_name" {
  # The 'description' attribute provides a human-readable explanation of the variable's purpose.
  # In this case, it describes that this variable specifies the name of the SSH key pair.
  description = "Name of the SSH key pair"

  # The 'type' attribute specifies the expected data type for the variable.
  # Here, the type is set to 'string', meaning the value must be a text string.
  type = string
}
```

---

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **Input Variables**:
   - Input variables are used to pass data into a Terraform module or configuration.
   - They make the module flexible and reusable by allowing users to customize its behavior without modifying the underlying code.

2. **Variable Block Structure**:
   - Each `variable` block defines a single input variable.
   - The block typically includes:
     - A **name** (`key_name`) that identifies the variable.
     - A **description** that explains the variable's purpose.
     - A **type** that specifies the expected data type (e.g., `string`, `number`, `list`, `map`).

3. **Attributes Explained**:
   - **`description`**: Provides context or documentation for the variable. This helps users understand what the variable is used for.
   - **`type`**: Specifies the data type of the variable. In this case, the type is `string`, meaning the value must be a text string.
   - (Optional) **`default`**: You can provide a default value for the variable, which will be used if no value is explicitly passed when calling the module.

4. **Reusability**:
   - By defining this variable, the module becomes configurable. Users can pass different values for `key_name` when calling the module, enabling them to create SSH key pairs with unique names.

---

### Example Usage of the Variable:
To use this variable, you would call the module from another Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf` in the root directory). Here’s an example:

```hcl
module "key_pair" {
  source = "./modules/key_pair"

  key_name = "my-key-pair"
}
```

In this example:
- The `key_name` variable is passed with the value `"my-key-pair"`.
- The module will use this value to create an AWS key pair named `my-key-pair`.

---

### Default Value (Optional Enhancement):
If you want to make the `key_name` variable optional, you can add a `default` value. For example:

```hcl
variable "key_name" {
  description = "Name of the SSH key pair"
  type        = string
  default     = "default-key-pair" # Default key name if not provided
}
```

This way, if the user does not specify a value for `key_name`, Terraform will use `"default-key-pair"` as the default.

---

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Modularity**: The module becomes self-contained and reusable, making it easy to create multiple SSH key pairs with different configurations.
2. **Customizability**: Users can customize the `key_name` variable without modifying the module code.
3. **Documentation**: The `description` field provides clear documentation for the variable, making it easier for users to understand how to use the module.

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **`aws_security_group` Resource**:
   - The `aws_security_group` resource creates a security group in AWS.
   - By default, it includes an egress rule that allows all outbound traffic (`egress` block).

2. **Default Egress Rule**:
   - The `egress` block allows all outbound traffic by specifying:
     - `from_port = 0` and `to_port = 0` (all ports).
     - `protocol = "-1"` (all protocols).
     - `cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]` (all IP addresses).

3. **Dynamic Ingress Rules**:
   - The `aws_security_group_rule` resource dynamically creates ingress rules based on the `var.ingress_rules` variable.
   - The `count` attribute iterates over the `var.ingress_rules` list to create one rule per entry.

4. **`lookup` Function**:
   - The `lookup` function retrieves a value from a map or object.
   - If the key does not exist, it returns a default value (e.g., `null` for `source_security_group_id` and `[]` for `cidr_blocks`).

5. **Input Variables**:
   - The `var.name` variable specifies the name of the security group.
   - The `var.ingress_rules` variable is a list of maps, where each map defines an ingress rule with attributes like `from_port`, `to_port`, `protocol`, etc.

6. **Reusability**:
   - By parameterizing the security group and its ingress rules, the module becomes highly configurable.
   - Users can pass different values for these variables when calling the module, enabling them to create security groups with varying configurations.

---

### Example Usage of the Module:
To use this module, you would call it from another Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf` in the root directory). Here’s an example:

```hcl
module "security_group" {
  source = "./modules/security_group"

  name = "my-security-group"

  ingress_rules = [
    {
      from_port   = 22
      to_port     = 22
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    },
    {
      from_port                = 80
      to_port                  = 80
      protocol                 = "tcp"
      source_security_group_id = "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Expected Outcome:
1. **Security Group Creation**:
   - A security group named `my-security-group` is created in AWS.
   - It includes a default egress rule that allows all outbound traffic.

2. **Ingress Rules**:
   - Two ingress rules are created:
     - Rule 1: Allows SSH access (port 22) from all IP addresses (`0.0.0.0/0`).
     - Rule 2: Allows HTTP access (port 80) from another security group (`sg-0123456789abcdef0`).

---

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Flexibility**: The module supports dynamic creation of ingress rules using the `var.ingress_rules` variable.
2. **Reusability**: The module can be reused to create multiple security groups with different configurations.
3. **Scalability**: Adding or modifying ingress rules is straightforward by updating the `var.ingress_rules` list.

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **Outputs in Terraform**:
   - Outputs are used to expose specific pieces of information about the infrastructure after it has been created.
   - They are particularly useful for retrieving dynamic values like resource IDs, names, or other attributes that are generated during the provisioning process.

2. **`aws_security_group.allow_ssh_http.id`**:
   - The `aws_security_group.allow_ssh_http` refers to the AWS security group resource defined in the configuration.
   - The `id` attribute is a property of the `aws_security_group` resource that contains the unique identifier (ID) of the security group.
   - This ID is required when associating the security group with other resources, such as EC2 instances.

3. **Output Block Structure**:

  ]
}

output "security_group_id" {
  value       = module.security_group.security_group_id
  description = "The ID of the security group created by the module."

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **Input Variables**:
   - Input variables are used to pass data into a Terraform module or configuration.
   - They make the module flexible and reusable by allowing users to customize its behavior without modifying the underlying code.

2. **Variable Block Structure**:
   - Each `variable` block defines a single input variable.
   - The block typically includes:
     - A **name** (e.g., `name`, `ingress_rules`) that identifies the variable.
     - A **description** that explains the variable's purpose.
     - A **type** that specifies the expected data type or structure.
     - (Optional) A **default** value that is used if no value is explicitly passed when calling the module.

3. **Attributes Explained**:
   - **`description`**: Provides context or documentation for the variable. This helps users understand what the variable is used for.
   - **`type`**: Specifies the data type or structure of the variable. For example:
     - `string`: A simple text string.
     - `list(object({...}))`: A list of objects, where each object has a specific structure.
   - **`default`**: Specifies a default value for the variable. If no value is provided, the default is used.

4. **Complex Types**:
   - The `ingress_rules` variable uses a complex type: `list(object({...}))`.
   - Each object in the list represents an ingress rule with attributes like `from_port`, `to_port`, `protocol`, etc.
   - The `optional` keyword makes certain attributes (e.g., `source_security_group_id`, `cidr_blocks`) optional, meaning they do not need to be provided.

5. **Reusability**:
   - By defining these variables, the `security_group` module becomes highly configurable.
   - Users can pass different values for these variables when calling the module, enabling them to create security groups with varying configurations.

### Example Usage of the Variables:
To use these variables, you would call the module from another Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf` in the root directory). Here’s an example:

```hcl
module "security_group" {
  source = "./modules/security_group"

  name = "my-security-group"

  ingress_rules = [
    {
      from_port   = 22
      to_port     = 22
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    },
    {
      from_port                = 80
      to_port                  = 80
      protocol                 = "tcp"
      source_security_group_id = "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- The `name` variable is passed with the value `"my-security-group"`.
- The `ingress_rules` variable is passed as a list of two ingress rules:
  - Rule 1: Allows SSH access (port 22) from all IP addresses (`0.0.0.0/0`).
  - Rule 2: Allows HTTP access (port 80) from another security group (`sg-0123456789abcdef0`).

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Flexibility**: The module supports dynamic creation of ingress rules using the `ingress_rules` variable.
2. **Reusability**: The module can be reused to create multiple security groups with different configurations.
3. **Scalability**: Adding or modifying ingress rules is straightforward by updating the `ingress_rules` list.
4. **Documentation**: The `description` field provides clear documentation for each variable, making it easier for users to understand how to use the module.
