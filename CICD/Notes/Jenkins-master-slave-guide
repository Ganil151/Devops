To set up a Jenkins worker node (agent) on an EC2 Ubuntu instance and connect it to your Jenkins master using the SSH method,

âœ… Part 1: Launch and Prepare the Worker EC2 Instance
1. Launch Ubuntu EC2 Instance (Worker Node)
Choose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Ensure itâ€™s in the same VPC or has connectivity to Jenkins master.

Assign a key pair and open port 22 (SSH) in the Security Group.

âœ… Part 2: Install Java on the Worker Node
SSH into the worker EC2 instance:

ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@<worker-public-ip>
Install Java (required by Jenkins agent):
FOLLOW OFFICAL GUIDE

ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step: Add Jenkins Node via SSH
Step 1: Generate SSH Key on Jenkins Master (if not done)

    ssh-keygen
    This generates keys in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Step 2: Copy Public Key to Agent Node
      manually append the public key to:



âœ… Prerequisites:
Jenkins master is up and running.

SSH is enabled on the agent machine.

Java is installed on the agent.

SSH key-based or password-based authentication is set up between master and agent.



Step 3: On Jenkins Dashboard (Master)
Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds.

Click on New Node.

Give it a name (e.g., agent-cloudaseem), select Permanent Agent, click OK.

Step 4: Configure Node Details
Field	Value
Remote root directory	/home/ubuntu or any path where Jenkins agent will run
Labels	build-node, linux, etc. (useful for targeting specific agents)

Usage	Choose whether Jenkins uses this node freely or only for labeled jobs

Launch Method	Launch agents via SSH

Host	IP address or hostname of the agent machine

Credentials	Add new credentials (Username + Private Key or Password)

Step 5: Add SSH Credentials (if needed)
Click Add next to "Credentials"

Choose:

Kind: SSH Username with private key

Username: jenkins (or whatever user is set up)

Private Key: Use the direct input option and paste contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa from master

Step 6: Save and Launch
Click Save

Jenkins will try to connect via SSH

Once connected, it will download the agent JAR and start the agent service

âœ… Verify
Go to Nodes section

Status should show "Online"

Try running a job on that node to verify execution
