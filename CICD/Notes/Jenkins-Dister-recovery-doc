**Jenkins Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategies and Implementation Guide**

---

### Overview

This document outlines essential Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies for Jenkins, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss in the event of failure. The three main methods covered include:

1. Automated EBS Volume Backups
2. AMI Backups of Jenkins Server
3. Jenkins Directory Backup to S3 Bucket and Restore Procedures

---

### 1. Automated EBS Volume Backups

**Objective:** Capture point-in-time snapshots of the Jenkins data volume.

**Approach:**

* Identify the EBS volume attached to the Jenkins EC2 instance.
* Use AWS Backup or a Lambda + CloudWatch Events combination to schedule regular snapshots.

**Sample Lambda Strategy:**

* Trigger: CloudWatch Event (Daily/Weekly)
* Function: Create snapshot using the `create-snapshot` API
* Tag snapshots for retention policies

**Benefits:**

* Quick volume-level restore
* Minimal configuration required

### 2. AMI Backup of Jenkins Server

**Objective:** Backup the complete Jenkins EC2 instance (OS + Jenkins config + installed tools).

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to EC2 Dashboard > Instances
2. Select Jenkins instance > Actions > Create Image (AMI)
3. Provide image name and description
4. Schedule AMI creation using Lambda + CloudWatch if needed

**Best Practices:**

* Tag AMIs with creation date and retention period
* Combine with EBS backup for complete DR coverage

**Use Case:**

* Fast recovery by launching new instance from AMI

### 3. Jenkins Directory Backup to S3 Bucket

**Objective:** Backup Jenkins configurations, jobs, and plugin data stored in `/var/lib/jenkins`

**Script Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%F-%H-%M)
BACKUP_DIR="/var/lib/jenkins"
S3_BUCKET="s3://your-jenkins-backup-bucket"

tar -czf /tmp/jenkins-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz $BACKUP_DIR
aws s3 cp /tmp/jenkins-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz $S3_BUCKET/
rm -f /tmp/jenkins-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
```

**Automation:**

* Set a cron job (e.g., daily at midnight)
* Ensure IAM role has `s3:PutObject` permission

**Restore Procedure:**

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://your-jenkins-backup-bucket/jenkins-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz .
sudo systemctl stop jenkins
sudo tar -xzf jenkins-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz -C /
sudo systemctl start jenkins
```

**Note:** Always verify permission and ownership settings after restore.

### Summary

| Method              | Scope                 | Tools             | Frequency    | Recovery Time |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| EBS Snapshot        | Data Volume           | AWS Backup/Lambda | Daily/Weekly | Moderate      |
| AMI Backup          | Full EC2 Instance     | EC2, Lambda       | Weekly       | Fast          |
| S3 Directory Backup | Jenkins Configuration | Cron, AWS CLI     | Daily        | Fast          |

---

**Recommendation:** Implement at least 2 of the 3 methods to ensure a robust Jenkins DR plan. Regularly test your restore procedures to validate recovery capability.
